  What is it? 
  -----------
  
  OpenSim is an open-source software system that lets users develop models of musculoskeletal
  structures and create dynamic simulations of movement. 

  why?
  -----

  The software provides a platform on which the biomechanics community can build a library   
  of simulations that can be exchanged, tested, analyzed, and improved through
  multi-institutional collaboration. 

  The underlying software is written in ANSI C++, and the graphical user interface (GUI) is 
  written in Java. OpenSim technology makes it possible to develop customized controllers,
  analyses, contact models, and muscle models among other things. These plugins can be shared
  without the need to alter or compile source code. Users can analyze existing models and
  simulations and develop new models and simulations from within the GUI.
