 * implicit integrator.  It provides a good combination of accuracy, stability, and speed, and
 * is a good choice for integrating stiff problems.
 * 
 * When creating a CPodesIntegrator, you can specify various options for how to perform
 * the implicit integration: the linear multistep method to use (Adams or BDF), and the nonlinear system
 * iteration type (Newton iteration or functional iteration).  For stiff problems, the recommended choices
 * are BDF with Newton iteration.  For non-stiff problems, using Adams and/or functional iteration may
 * provide better performance.  Note that Adams is <i>never</i> recommended for systems that include
