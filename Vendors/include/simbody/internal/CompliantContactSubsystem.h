//                               CONTACT FORCE
//==============================================================================
/** This is a simple class containing the basic force information for a 
single contact between deformable surfaces S1 and S2 mounted on rigid
bodies B1 and B2. Every contact interaction between two rigid bodies, however 
complex, can be expressed as a resultant that can be contained in this class 
and is sufficient for advancing a simulation. Optionally, you may be able to 
get more details about the deformed geometry and pressure distribution over the
patch but you have to ask for that separately because it can be expensive to
calculate or report.

The information stored here is:
  - A point in space at which equal and opposite forces will be applied to
    corresponding stations of the two interacting rigid bodies. This is called
    the "contact point".
  - The force vector to be applied there (to each body with opposite sign).
  - A moment vector to be applied to both bodies (with opposite signs).
  - The potential energy currently stored by the elasticity of the contacting
    materials.
  - The instantaneous power dissipation due to inelastic behavior such as 
    friction and internal material damping.

Points and vectors are measured and expressed in some assumed but unspecified
frame A, which might for example be the frame of one of the two surfaces, or
one of the two bodies, or Ground. Whenever a method returns a ContactForce
object it must document what frame is being used; typically that will be
Ground for end user use.

<h3>Definition of center of pressure</h3>

When the contact patch itself involves many distributed contact points, the
center of pressure might not be a particularly meaningful quantity but 
serves to provide enough information to proceed with a simulation, and to
display resultant contact forces, without requiring detailed patch geometry
information. We define the location r_c of the center of pressure like this:
@verbatim
           sum_i (r_i * |r_i X Fn_i|) 
     r_c = --------------------------
              sum_i |r_i X Fn_i|
@endverbatim
where r_i is the vector locating contact point i, F_i=Fn_i+Ft_i is the 
contact force at point i resolved into locally-normal and locally-tangential
components, and M_i is a pure moment if any generated by the contact force 
model as a result of the i'th contact point. Note that the locally-
tangent contact force Ft_i (presumably from friction) and pure moment M_i
do not contribute to the center of pressure calculation; we're choosing
the point that minimizes the net moment generated by normal ("pressure")
forces only. Note that the normal force Fn_i includes both stiffness and
dissipation contributions, so the center of pressure can be 
velocity-dependent. **/

//                              CONTACT DETAIL
//==============================================================================
/** This provides deformed geometry and force details for one element of a
contact patch that may be composed of many elements. Depending on the contact
model, the element or elements may be associated with the patch itself, or
the elements may be associated with the contacting surfaces. However, in all
cases every element generates equal and opposite forces on both surfaces so
we can use a consistent patch-centered convention for reporting details 
regardless of the original source of the element. We do make note of which
element we're reporting for here in case this information is of use to the
caller, but in most cases it can be ignored.

<h3>Deformed patch geometry</h3>

We return a "patch frame" P for the element with this meaning:
  - the origin OP is the contact point where equal and opposite forces are
    applied to <em>material points</em> of the two surfaces
  - the z axis points in the contact normal direction \e away from surface1
    and towards surface2
  - the x,y axes form a coordinate frame for the contact patch whose meaning
    (if any) depends on the particulars of the contact model (e.g., might be
    the semi axes of an elliptical contact patch).

The patch frame P is reported in ground, via a Transform X_GP, however of more
relevance are two frames P1 and P2 which are fixed to surface1's and 
surface2's rigid bodies, resp., and instantaneously coincident with P. These
would be located on their bodies via X_B1P1 and X_B2P2, although we don't
report those here (you can easily calculate them). It is 
important to note that we are interested in the motion (deformations) of 
<em>material points</em> here, \e not the motion of the <em>contact point</em>
which is a non-material concept and thus not directly involved in producing 
forces.

The patch itself is defined by giving its half dimensions along P's x and
y axes; it is assumed symmetric about the origin. These dimensions are not
necessarily meaningful, depending on the particulars of the contact model in
use. The patch area is provided separately and its significance also depends
on the model.

<h3>Elasticity and dissipation</h3>

Elastic deformation of the element is reported as a vector r in P. The -z 
component is the normal compression of the element (that is, it will be a
negative number), x,y gives the tangential deformation (often zero but can
be either sign). The vector -r thus gives the original (undeformed) location
of the material point now at OP. Note that we do 
not attempt to report angular deformation of the element.

Elastic deformation rate rdot=d/dt r (with the derivative taken in P) is also 
provided. This is the rate that the material point currently at OP is moving 
with respect to frame P, if you think of P as being instantaneously fixed with
respect to the element's rigid body. That is, we are not
including the fact that the contact point OP and frame P may be moving along 
the surfaces, we just report what is happening to the material in its own 
frame. Note that we do not attempt to report angular deformation rate.

<h3>Slipping and friction</h3>

Slip velocity is the \e spatial velocity (that is, angular and linear) of
this element's material in the patch with respect to the other surface's
corresponding material, measured at OP and expressed in P. The linear z 
component is zero unless the surfaces are separating in which case it will
be positive. Linear x,y is the slip vector which is the relative x-y motion
of P1 and P2 minus the deformation rates of the two surfaces so that it 
represents actual material-over-material slippage. The angular z component is 
the "spin" rate about the normal with angular x,y representing the "roll" rate.

<h3>%Force and pressure</h3>

%Contact force is the \e spatial force (that is, moment and linear force) being 
applied to this surface at the contact point OP, expressed in P. The linear
z component is the normal force due to elasticity and dissipation, and will be
negative as long as the surfaces aren't sticking. The (x,y) components are
the tangential force due to friction and to tangential elasticity and
dissipation, if any. The z component of the moment, if any, is the torsional
friction and the (x,y) moment is the rolling resistance.

Peak pressure is a scalar providing the worst-case pressure present somewhere
in the patch, if the model can provide that. Otherwise it should just be the
normal force divided by the patch area to give the average pressure across
the patch. 

<h3>Energy and power</h3>

Potential energy is the amount of energy currently stored in the elastic
deformation of this element. Summing this over all the contact detail 
elements should yield the same value as is reported as the resultant potential
energy for this contact.

Power loss is the rate at which energy is being lost due to dissipation and
to friction, but not due to elastic deformation because that is contributing
to potential energy and we expect to get it back. Summing this over all the
contact detail elements should yield the same value as is reported as the
resultant power loss for this contact. **/

/** A ContactPatch is the description of the forces and the deformed shape of
the contact surfaces that result from compliant contact interactions. This
should not be confused with the Contact object that describes only the 
overlap in \e undeformed surface geometry and knows nothing of forces or
materials. Although there are several qualitatively different kinds of 
compliant contact models, we assume that each can be described by some number 
of contact "elements" and report the detailed results in terms 
of those elements. Depending on the model, the elements may be associated with
the surfaces or may be associated with the patch. Either way, every element 
applies equal and opposite forces to both surfaces. There is not necessarily 
any direct correspondence between elements on one surface with elements on the 
other.

A Hertz contact will have only a single element that belongs to the patch,
while an elastic foundation contact will have many, with each element
associated with one or the other surface. Only the elements that are currently 
participating in contact will have entries here; the surface and element id is 
stored with each piece of ContactDetail information. There is also some basic 
information needed to advance the simulation and that is common to all contact
patch types and stored as a ContactForce resultant. **/
