/**
 * The Simbody low-level multibody tree interface.
 * Equations represented:

 *                  zdot = zdot(t,q,u,z)
 *

 *      G udot           = b(t,q,u) 
 *
 *              where
 *
 *       [P]    [bp]
 *     G=[V]  b=[bv]  f=T+J*(F-C)
 *       [A]    [ba]
 *
 *       pdotdot = P udot - bp(t,q,u) = 0
 *          vdot = V udot - bv(t,q,u) = 0

 *           
 *                pdot = P u - c(t,q) = 0
 *                           v(t,q,u) = 0
 *
 *                             p(t,q) = 0
 *                               n(q) = 0
 * </pre>
 * 
 * where M(q) is the mass matrix, G(q) the acceleration constraint matrix, C(q,u)
 * the coriolis and gyroscopic forces, T is user-applied joint mobility forces,
 * F is user-applied body forces and torques and gravity. 
 * J* is the operator that maps spatial forces to joint mobility forces. p() are the
 * holonomic (position) constraints, v() the non-holonomic (velocity) constraints,
 * and a() the acceleration-only constraints, which must be linear, with A
 * the coefficient matrix for a(). pdot, pdotdot are obtained
 * by differentiation of p(), vdot by differentiation of v().
 * P=partial(pdot)/partial(u) (yes, that's u, not q), V=partial(v)/partial(u).
 * (We can get partial(p)/partial(q) when we need it as P*N^-1.)
 * n(q) is the set of quaternion normalization constraints, which exist only at the
 * position level and are uncoupled from everything else.
 *
 * We calculate the constraint multipliers like this:
 *           G M^-1 ~G mult = G udot0 - b, udot0=M^-1 f
 * using the pseudo inverse of G M^-1 ~G to give a least squares solution for
 * mult: mult = pinv(G M^-1 ~G)(G M^-1 f - b). Then the real udot is
 * udot = udot0 - udotC, with udotC = M^-1 ~G mult. Note: M^-1* is an
 * O(N) operator that provides the desired result; it *does not* require
 * forming or factoring M.
 *
 * NOTE: only the following constraint matrices have to be formed and factored:
 * @verbatim
 *    [G M^-1 ~G]   to calculate multipliers (square, symmetric: LDL' if
 *                  well conditioned, else pseudoinverse)
 *
 *    [P N^-1]      for projection onto position manifold (pseudoinverse)
 *
 *    [P;V]         for projection onto velocity manifold (pseudoinverse)
 *                  (using Matlab notation meaning rows of P over rows of V)
 * @endverbatim
 *
 * When working in a weighted norm with weights W on the state variables and
 * weights T (1/tolerance) on the constraint errors, the matrices we need are
 * actually [Tp PN^-1 Wq^-1], [Tpv [P;V] Wu^-1], etc. with T and W diagonal
 * weighting matrices. These can then be used to find least squares solutions
 * in the weighted norms.
 *
 * In many cases these matrices consist of decoupled blocks which can
 * be solved independently; we try to take advantage of that whenever possible
 * to solve a set of smaller systems rather than one large one. Also, in the
 * majority of biosimulation applications we are likely to have only holonomic
 * (position) constraints, so there is no V or A and G=P is the whole story.

     * and those resulting from centrifugal effects, affect the results. Everything
     * in the matter subsystem is accounted for including velocities and 
     * acceleration constraints, which will always be satisified as long as the
     * constraints are consistent. If the position and velocity constraints
     * aren't already satisified in the State, these accelerations
     * are harder to interpret physically, but they will still be calculated and
     * the acceleration constraints will still be satisfied. No attempt
     * will be made to satisfy position and velocity constraints, or even to check
     * whether they are statisfied.
