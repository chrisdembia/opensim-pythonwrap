class GeneralContactSubsystem;
class ElasticFoundationForceImpl;

/**
 * This class implements an elastic foundation or "bed of springs" contact model.  It places
 * springs over the surface of a triangle mesh, each of which independently interacts with
 * objects in contact with the mesh.  The interaction includes components for the normal
 * restoring force, dissipation in the material, and surface friction.  This force
 * is only applied to contacts involving a triangle mesh, though the object colliding with
 * the mesh may be of any type.  Contacts which do not involve a triangle mesh are ignored.
 *
 * This class relies on a GeneralContactSubsystem to identify contacts, then applies
 * forces to all contacts in a single contact set.  To use it, do the following:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Add a GeneralContactSubsystem and GeneralForceSubsystem to a MultibodySystem.</li>
 * <li>Create a contact set within the GeneralContactSubsystem, and add ContactGeometry objects to it.</li>
 * <li>Add an ElasticFoundationForce to the GeneralForceSubsystem, and call setBodyParameters() on it
 * once for each TriangleMesh in the contact set.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * A spring is placed at the center of each face of each triangle mesh.  When a mesh collides with
 * any other object, the other object is considered to be rigid and the displacement of each spring is
 * calculated independently.  A spring is considered to be displaced if its base location is inside
 * the other object, and the contact point is taken to be the nearest point on that object's surface.
 * When two meshes collide, the springs on each mesh are treated independently: each mesh is assumed
 * to be rigid for purposes of calculating the force exerted by the other mesh's springs.
 *
 * <h1>Normal Force Components</h1>
 *
 * The force exerted by each spring along its displacement direction is given by
 *
 * f = k*a*x*(1+c*v)
 * 
 * where k is the spring stiffness, a is the area of the face the spring belongs to, x is the displacement
 * distance, c is the spring's dissipation coefficient, and v=dx/dt.  If the springs are assumed
 * to represent a uniform layer of elastic material over a rigid substrate, the stiffness is given by
 *
 * k = (1-p)*E/((1+p)(1-2p)*h)
 *
 * where E is the Young's modulus of the elastic layer, p is its Poisson's ratio, and h is its thickness.
 * 
 * <h1>Friction Force</h1>
 *
 * The friction force exerted by each spring is based on a model by Michael Hollars:
 *
 * f = fn*[min(vs/vt,1)*(ud+2(us-ud)/(1+(vs/vt)^2))+uv*vs]
 *
 * where fn is the normal force at the contact point, vs is the slip (tangential)
 * velocity of the two bodies at the contact point, vt is a transition velocity
 * (see below), and us, ud, and uv are the coefficients of static, dynamic, and
 * viscous friction respectively.
 *
 * Because the friction force is a continuous function of the slip velocity, this
 * model cannot represent stiction; as long as a tangential force is applied, the
 * two bodies will move relative to each other.  There will always be a nonzero
 * drift, no matter how small the force is.  The transition velocity vt acts as an
 * upper limit on the drift velocity.  By setting vt to a sufficiently small value,
 * the drift velocity can be made arbitrarily small, at the cost of making the
 * equations of motion very stiff.  The default value of vt is 0.01.
