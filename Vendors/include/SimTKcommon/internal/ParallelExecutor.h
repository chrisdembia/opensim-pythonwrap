/**
 * This class is used for performing multithreaded computations.  To use it, define a subclass of
 * ParallelExecutor::Task that performs some computation.  Then create a ParallelExecutor object
 * and ask it to execute the task:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ParallelExecutor executor;
 * executor.execute(myTask, times);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The Task's execute() method will be called the specified number of times, with each invocation
 * being given a different index value from 0 to times-1.  The invocations are done in parallel
 * on multiple threads, so you cannot make any assumptions about what order they will occur in
 * or which ones will happen at the same time.
 * 
 * The threads are created in the ParallelExecutor's constructor and remain active until it is deleted.
 * This means that creating a ParallelExecutor is a somewhat expensive operation, but it may then be
 * used repeatedly for executing various calculations.  By default, the number of threads is chosen
 * to be equal to the number of available processor cores.  You can optionally specify a different number
 * of threads to create.  For example, using more threads than processors can sometimes lead to better
 * processor utilitization.  Alternatively, if the Task will only be executed four times, you might
 * specify max(4, ParallelExecutor::getNumProcessors()) to avoid creating extra threads that will never
 * have any work to do.
