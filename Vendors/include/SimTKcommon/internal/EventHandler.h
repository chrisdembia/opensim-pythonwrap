/**
 * An EventHandler is an object that defines an event that can occur within a system.
 * It is an abstract class.  Subclasses define how to determine when the event occurs,
 * and what happens when it does.  You will not generally subclass EventHandler
 * directly.  Instead, subclass ScheduledEventHandler (for events that occur at a
 * particular time that is know in advance) or TriggeredEventHandler (for events that
 * occur when some condition is satisfied within the system).  ScheduledEventHandler
 * also has another subclass, PeriodicEventHandler, for the common situation of
 * events that occur at regular intervals.
 * 
 * An EventHandler should be thought of as an integral part of the system it belongs
 * to, and may alter the physical properties or behavior of the system.  If you merely
 * want to observe the system but not to alter it, you should generally use a
 * EventReporter instead.
 * 
 * Once you have created an EventHandler, you can add it to a System by calling
 * updDefaultSubsystem().addEventHandler() on the System.
