/**
 * The handle class which serves as the abstract parent of all System handles.
 *
 * A System serves as a mediator for a group of interacting Subsystems. All will 
 * share a single system State, and typically subsystems will need access to 
 * content in the state which is produced by other subsystems. 
 *
 * A System provides a unique SubsystemIndex (a small positive integer) for each
 * of its subsystems, and the subsystems are constructed knowing their indices. 
 * The indices are used subsequently by the subsystems to find their own entries 
 * in the system state, and by each subsystem to refer to others within the same
 * system. Index 0 is reserved for use by the System itself, e.g. for 
 * system-global state variables.
 *
 * Concrete Systems understand the kinds of subsystems they contain. For example, 
 * a MultibodySystem might contain a mechanical subsystem, some force subsystems, 
 * and a geometry subsystem. At each computation stage, a subsystem is realized 
 * in a single operation. That operation can refer to computations from 
 * already-realized subsystems, but cannot initiate computation in other 
 * subsystems. The System must know the proper order with which to realize the 
 * subsystems at each stage, and that ordering is likely to vary with stage. For 
 * example, at Position stage the mechanical positions must be realized before 
 * the configuration-dependent force elements. However, at Acceleration stage, 
 * the force elements must be realized before the mechanical accelerations can 
 * be calculated.
 *
 * There are two distinct users of this class:
 *   - System Users: people who are making use of a concrete System (which will
 *     inherit methods from this class)
 *   - System Developers: people who are writing concrete System classes
 * Note that System Users include people who are writing Studies, Reporters, 
 * Modelers and so on as well as end users who are accessing the System directly.
 *
 * Only methods intended for System Users and a few bookkeeping methods are in 
 * the main System class, which is a SimTK Handle class, meaning that it consists 
 * only of a single pointer, which points to a System::Guts class. The Guts class 
 * is abstract, and virtual methods to be implemented by System Developers in the 
 * concrete System are defined there, along with other utilities of use to the 
 * concrete System Developer but not to the end user. The Guts class is declared 
 * in a separate header file, and only people who are writing their own System
 * classes need look there.
