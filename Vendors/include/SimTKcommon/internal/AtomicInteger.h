/**
 * This class functions exactly like an int, except that the following operators are atomic:
 * ++, --, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=, <<=, and >>=.  For example, suppose myInt is an AtomicInteger
 * that initially has the value 5.  If two threads both evaluate the expression ++myInt, it is guaranteed
 * that one thread will get the value 6 and the other will get the value 7, and myInt will
 * equal 7 afterward.  This would not be true for an ordinary int.
 * 
 * On most processors, this form of thread-safety can be implemented in a lightweight way
 * which is much faster than acquiring a lock.  When possible, this class uses these mechanisms
 * to achieve maximum efficiency.  On platforms that do not support atomic operations directly
 * it uses locking, which is slower but still guaranteed to produce a correct result.
