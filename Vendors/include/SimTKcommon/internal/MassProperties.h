/**
 * The physical meaning of an inertia is the distribution of
 * a rigid body's mass about a *particular* point. If that point is the
 * center of mass of the body, then the measured inertia is called
 * the "central inertia" of that body. To write down the inertia, we
 * need to calculate the six scalars of the inertia tensor, which
 * is a symmetric 3x3 matrix. These scalars must be expressed in 
 * an arbitrary but specified coordinate system. So an Inertia
 * is meaningful only in conjunction with a particular set of axes, fixed
 * to the body, whose origin is the point about which the inertia is being
 * measured, and in whose coordinate system this measurement is being
 * expressed. Note that changing the reference point results in a new
 * physical quantity, but changing the reference axes only affects the
 * measure numbers of that quantity. For any reference point, there
 * is a unique set of reference axes in which the inertia tensor is
 * diagonal; those are called the "principal axes" of the body at that
 * point, and the resulting diagonal elements are the "principal moments
 * of inertia". When we speak of an inertia being "in" a frame, we mean
 * the physical quantity measured about the frame's origin and then expressed
 * in the frame's axes.
 *
 * This low-level Inertia class does not attempt to keep track of *which*
 * frame it is in. It concentrates instead on providing construction and
 * operations involving inertia which can proceed using only an implicit
 * frame F. Clients of this class are responsible for keeping track of that frame.
 * In particular, in order to shift the inertia's "measured-about" point one
 * must know whether either the starting or final inertia is central,
 * because we must always shift inertias by passing through the central inertia.
 * So this class provides operations for doing the shifting, but expects
 * to be told by the client where to find the center of mass.
 *
 * Re-expressing an Inertia in a different coordinate system does not
 * entail a change of physical meaning in the way that shifting it to a
 * different point does. Note that because inertia is a tensor, there is
 * a "left frame" and "right frame". For our purposes, these
 * will always be the same so we'll only indicate the frame 
 * once, as in 'I_pt_frame'. This should be understood to mean
 * 'frame_I_pt_frame' and re-expressing an Inertia requires both a
 * left and right multiply by the rotation matrix. So I_OB_B is the
 * inertia about body B's origin point OB, expressed in B, while
 * I_OB_G is the same physical quantity but expressed in Ground (the latter
 * is a component of the Spatial Inertia). Conversion is done like this:
 *    I_OB_G = R_GB * I_OB_B * R_BG  (and recall that R_GB=~R_BG)
 * The central inertia would be I_CB_B for body B.
 *
 * A Inertia is a symmetric matrix and is positive definite for
 * nonsingular bodies (that is, a body composed of at least three
 * noncollinear point masses).
