/**
 * The physical meaning of an inertia is the distribution of a rigid body's mass 
 * about a \e particular point. If that point is the center of mass of the body, 
 * then the measured inertia is called the "central inertia" of that body. To 
 * write down the inertia, we need to calculate the six scalars of the inertia 
 * tensor, which is a symmetric 3x3 matrix. These scalars must be expressed in 
 * an arbitrary but specified coordinate system. So an Inertia is meaningful only 
 * in conjunction with a particular set of axes, fixed to the body, whose origin 
 * is the point about which the inertia is being measured, and in whose 
 * coordinate system this measurement is being expressed. Note that changing the 
 * reference point results in a new physical quantity, but changing the reference 
 * axes only affects the measure numbers of that quantity. For any reference 
 * point, there is a unique set of reference axes in which the inertia tensor is
 * diagonal; those are called the "principal axes" of the body at that point, and 
 * the resulting diagonal elements are the "principal moments of inertia". When 
 * we speak of an inertia being "in" a frame, we mean the physical quantity 
 * measured about the frame's origin and then expressed in the frame's axes.
 *
 * This low-level Inertia class does not attempt to keep track of \e which frame 
 * it is in. It provides construction and operations involving inertia that can 
 * proceed using only an implicit frame F. Clients of this class are responsible 
 * for keeping track of that frame. In particular, in order to shift the 
 * inertia's "measured-about" point one must know whether either the starting or 
 * final inertia is central, because we must always shift inertias by passing 
 * through the central inertia. So this class provides operations for doing the 
 * shifting, but expects to be told by the client where to find the center of mass.
 *
 * Re-expressing an Inertia in a different coordinate system does not entail a 
 * change of physical meaning in the way that shifting it to a different point 
 * does. Note that because inertia is a tensor, there is a "left frame" and 
 * "right frame". For our purposes, these will always be the same so we'll only 
 * indicate the frame once, as in 'I_pt_frame'. This should be understood to mean
 * 'frame_I_pt_frame' and re-expressing an Inertia requires both a left and right 
 * multiply by the rotation matrix. So I_OB_B is the inertia about body B's 
 * origin point OB, expressed in B, while I_OB_G is the same physical quantity 
 * but expressed in Ground (the latter is a component of the Spatial Inertia
 * which we usually want in the Ground frame). Frame conversion is done logically 
 * like this:
 * <pre>
 *    I_OB_G = R_GB * I_OB_B * R_BG  (R_BG=~R_GB)
 * </pre>
 * but we can save computation time by performing this as a single operation.
 *
 * The central inertia would be I_CB_B for body B.
 *
 * A Inertia is a symmetric matrix and is positive definite for
 * nonsingular bodies (that is, a body composed of at least three
 * noncollinear point masses).
 *
 * Some attempt is made to check the validity of an Inertia matrix, at least
 * when running in Debug mode. Some conditions it must satisfy are:
 *  - must be symmetric
 *  - all diagonal elements must be nonnegative
 *  - diagonal elements must satisfy the triangle inequality (sum of any two
 *    is greater than or equal the other one)

/**
 * A spatial inertia contains the mass, center of mass point, and inertia
 * matrix for a rigid body. This is 10 independent quantities altogether; however,
 * inertia is mass-scaled making it linearly dependent on the mass. Here instead 
 * we represent inertia using a gyration matrix, which is equivalent to the 
 * inertia this body would have if it had unit mass. Then the actual inertia is 
 * given by mass*gyration. In this manner the mass, center of mass location, and 
 * gyration are completely independent so can be changed separately. That means 
 * if you double the mass, you'll also double the inertia as you would expect.
 *
 * Spatial inertia may be usefully viewed as a symmetric spatial matrix, that is, 
 * a 6x6 symmetric matrix arranged as 2x2 blocks of 3x3 matrices. Although this 
 * class represents the spatial inertia in compact form, it supports methods and
 * operators that allow it to behave as though it were a spatial matrix (except
 * much faster to work with). In spatial matrix form, the matrix has the following 
 * interpretation:
 * <pre>
 *               [  m*G   m*px ]
 *           M = [             ]
 *               [ -m*px  m*I  ]
 * </pre>
 * Here m is mass, p is the vector from the body origin to the center of mass, 
 * G is the 3x3 symmetric gyration matrix, and I is a 3x3 identity matrix.
 * "px" indicates the skew symmetric cross product matrix formed from the vector p,
 * so -px=~px.

/**
 * An articulated body inertia (ABI) matrix P(q) contains the spatial inertia 
 * properties that a body appears to have when it is the free base body of 
 * an articulated multibody tree in a given configuration q. Despite the 
 * complex relative motion that occurs within a multibody tree, at any given 
 * configuration q there is still a linear relationship between a spatial 
 * force F applied to a point of the base body and the resulting acceleration 
 * A of that body and that point: F = P(q)*A + c, where c is a velocity-
 * dependent inertial bias force. P is thus analogous to a rigid body 
 * spatial inertia (RBI), but for a body which has other bodies connected to it
 * by joints which are free to move.
 *
 * An ABI P is a symmetric 6x6 spatial matrix, consisting of 2x2 blocks of 3x3 
 * matrices, similar to the RBI. However, unlike the RBI which has only 10 independent
 * elements, all 21 elements of P's lower triangle are significant. For example,
 * the apparent mass of an articulated body depends on which way you push it,
 * and in general there is no well-defined center of mass. This
 * is a much more expensive matrix to manipulate than an RBI. In Simbody's formulation,
 * we only work with ABIs in the Ground frame, so there
 * is never a need to rotate or re-express them. (That is done by rotating RBIs
 * prior to using them to construct the ABIs.) Thus only shifting operations need
 * be performed when transforming ABIs from body to body.
 * Cheap rigid body shifting is done when moving an ABI 
 * within a body or across a prescribed mobilizer; otherwise we have to perform 
 * an articulated shift operation which is quite expensive.
 *
 * For a full discussion of the properties of articulated body inertias, see 
 * Section 7.1 (pp. 119-123) of Roy Featherstone's excellent 2008 book, Rigid 
 * Body Dynamics Algorithms. 
 *
 * In spatial matrix form, an ABI P may be considered to consist of the 
 * following 3x3 subblocks:
 * <pre>
 *          P =  [ J  F ]
 *               [~F  M ]
 * </pre>
 * Here M is a (symmetric) mass distribution, F is a full matrix giving the
 * first mass moment distribution, and J is a (symmetric) inertia matrix.
