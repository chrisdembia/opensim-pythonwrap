/**
 * This is the handle class for the hidden State implementation.
 *
 * This object is intended to contain all State information for a
 * SimTK::System, except topological information which is stored
 * in the System itself. A System is "const" after its topology
 * has been constructed and realized.
 *
 * Systems are composed of Subsystems, and the State supports that
 * concept by allowing per-subsystem partitioning of the total System
 * state. This allows subsytems to have their own private state
 * variables, while permitting the system to allow shared access
 * to state among the subsystems when necessary.
 *
 * The State provides services reflecting the structure of the equations
 * it expects to find in the System. Three different views of the
 * same state information are supported to accommodate three 
 * different users:
 *    - the System as a whole
 *    - Subsystems contained in the System
 *    - numerical methods operating on the state
 *
 * Typically numerical methods have a much less nuanced view of the state
 * than do the System or Subsystems.
 *
 * The system is expected to be a "hybrid DAE", that is, a mixture
 * of continuous and discrete dynamic equations, and algebraic constraints.
 * There is an independent variable t, continuous state variables y, and
 * discrete state variables d.
 *
 * The continuous part is an ODE-on-a-manifold system suitable for solution
 * via coordinate projection, structured like this for the view taken
 * by numerical methods:
 * <pre>
 *      (1)  y' = f(d;t,y)         differential equations
 *      (2)  c  = c(d;t,y)         algebraic equations (manifold is c=0)
 *      (3)  e  = e(d;t,y)         event triggers (watch for zero crossings)
 * </pre>
 * with initial conditions t0,y0,d0 such that c=0. The discrete variables d
 * are updated upon occurence of specific events, which are
 * detected using the set of scalar-valued event trigger functions e (3).
 *
 * In the more detailed view as seen from the System, we consider y={q,u,z}
 * to be partitioned into position variables q, velocity variables u, and
 * auxiliary variables z. There will be algebraic constraints involving q, u,
 * and u's time derivatives udot. The system is now assumed to look like this:
 * <pre>
 *      (4) qdot    = N(q) u
 *      (5) zdot    = zdot(d;t,q,u,z)
 *
 *      (6) M(q) udot + ~G(q) mult = f(d;t,q,u,z)
 *          G(q) udot              = b(d;t,q,u)
 *
 *      (7) udotErr = [ pdotdot(d;t,q,u,udot) ] = 0
 *                    [ vdot(d;t,q,u,udot)    ]
 *                    [ a(d;t,q,u,udot)       ] 
 *
 *      (8) uErr    = [ pdot(d;t,q,u) ]
 *                    [ v(d;t,q,u)    ]         = 0
 *
 *      (9) qErr    = [ p(d;t,q) ]              = 0
 *                    [ n(q)     ]
 * </pre>
 * The q's can also be dealt with directly as second order variables via
 * <pre>
 *     (10) qdotdot = Ndot(q,qdot) u + N(q) udot
 * </pre>
 *
 * Here G = [P;V;A] with A(q) being the coefficient matrix for constraints
 * appearing only at the acceleration level, and V(q)=partial(v)/partial(u)
 * the coefficient matrix for the velocity (nonholonomic) constraints, and
 * P(q)=partial(pdot)/partial(u) is the coefficient matrix of the first
 * time derivatives of the position (holonomic) constraints.
 * Note that uErr in Eq 8 is assumed to include equations resulting from
 * differentiation of p() in Eq 9, as well as ones first introduced at the
 * velocity level (nonholonomic constraints), and udotErr is similarly 
 * built from acceleration-only constraints a() and derivatives of higher-level
 * constraints.
 *
 * If a system allocates nq q's, nu u's, and nz z's the State will also
 * allocate matching cache variables qdot, qdotdot, udot, and zdot. If
 * mp position (holonomic) constraints (9), mpv velocity constraints (8) and 
 * mpva acceleration constraints (7) are allocated, the state creates
 * cache entries of like sizes qErr, uErr, udotErr. In addition room
 * for the mpva Lagrange multipliers 'mult' is allocated in the cache.
 *
 * In the final view, the Subsystem view, the same variables and cache
 * entries exist, but only the ones allocated by that Subsystem are
 * visible. All of a Subsystem's q's are consecutive in memory, as are
 * its u's, uErr's, etc., but the q's are not adjacent to the u's as
 * they are for the System's view.
 *
 * The default constructor creates a State containing no state variables
 * and with its realization cache stage set to Stage::Empty.
 * During Subsystem construction, variables and cache entries for any
 * stage can be allocated, however *all* Model stage variables
 * must be allocated during this time. At the end of construction,
 * call advanceSubsystemToStage(Topology) which will put the Subsystem
 * at Stage::Topology. Then the Subsystems realize their Model stages, during which 
 * variables at any stage > Model, and cache entries at any stage
 * >= Model can be allocated. After that call advanceSubsystemToStage(Model)
 * which sets the stage to Stage::Model and disallows further allocation.
 *
 * Note that there is a global Stage for the state as a whole, and individual
 * Stages for each subsystem. The global stage can never be higher than
 * the lowest subsystem stage. Global state resources are allocated when the
 * global Stage advances to "Model" and tossed out if that stage is
 * invalidated. Similarly cache resources are allocated at stage Instance
 * and forgotten when Instance is invalidated. Note that subsystems will
 * "register" their use of the global variable pools during their own modeling
 * stages, but that the actual global resources won't exist until the *System* 
 * has been advanced to Model or Instance stage.
