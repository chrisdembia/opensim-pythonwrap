/**
 * This class encapsulates the handling of file and directory pathnames
 * in a platform-independent manner. We consider a pathname to consist
 * of three components:
 * <pre> [directory] [filename [extension]] </pre>
 * where the directory may be an absolute location or relative to a
 * current working directory. 
 *
 * Several special directory names are supported here:
 *  - root (/)
 *  - current working directory (.)
 *  - current executable directory (@)
 *  - platform default installation directory
 *  - parent directory (..)
 *
 * On Windows root and current working directory are drive-specific, referring
 * to the current drive if none is specified. The current executable 
 * directory is the absolute directory name containing the executable
 * program which is currently running.
 *
 * A pathname has "segments" which are separated by either forward 
 * slashes or backslashes. We are relaxed about the slashes and will
 * accept either one and pathnames which use both. However, each operating
 * system platform has a preferred separator character, backslash on
 * Windows and forward slash everywhere else and we will clean up
 * returned pathnames to use exclusively the preferred separator for
 * the current platform.
 *
 * Pathnames that end in an empty segment, or a segment consisting of
 * just "." or ".." are directory path names, meaning that the "filename"
 * and "extension" components are empty. Other pathnames may be directories
 * or filenames depending on context. Whenever we generate a pathname that
 * we know to e a directory, it will end in a final slash.
 *
 * There is also the concept of a "drive" which on Windows is a drive 
 * letter followed by a colon (e.g. "c:") but is always the empty string 
 * on non-Windows platforms. The drive, if present is considered part of 
 * the directory and does not affect whether the directory is considered 
 * relative or absolute. Drive designators are recognized only on Windows;
 * they are just considered ordinary pathname characters on other platforms.
 *
 * This class is useful for generating "canonicalized" pathnames from
 * names that have been pieced together from environment variables and
 * user entry. Canonicalized names are always absolute pathnames; they
 * contain no empty, ".", or ".." segments. On Windows a canonicalized
 * name is always prefixed by an explicit disk designator followed by
 * a backslash; on other platforms the canonicalized name will always
 * begin with a forward slash.

/**
 * This is the base class for representing a runtime-linked dynamic library,
 * also known as a "plugin", in a platform-independent manner. For any particular 
 * kind of plugin, derive a concrete class from this one and use the macros 
 * to describe the functions or data you expect to find there. Then each 
 * plugin library you load of that type is an object of the concrete class
 * you defined. The derived class constructor sets the search policy for
 * plugin libraries of that type. For example:
 * <pre>
 * class MyPlugin : public Plugin {
 * public:
 *     explicit MyPlugin() : Plugin() {
 *         addSearchDirectory(Pathname::getInstallDir("SimTK_INSTALL_DIR", "SimTK") 
 *                             + "/lib/plugins/");
 *     }
 * 
 *     SimTK_PLUGIN_DEFINE_FUNCTION1(int,exportedFunctionWithOneArg,const std::string&);
 *     SimTK_PLUGIN_DEFINE_FUNCTION(SomeObjectType*,anExportedFunctionNoArgs);
 *     SimTK_PLUGIN_DEFINE_FUNCTION(void, someFunction);
 *     SimTK_PLUGIN_DEFINE_SYMBOL(SymbolType, nameOfExportedSymbol);
 * };
 * </pre>
 *
 * Then this class is used as follows:
 * <pre>
 *     MyPlugin lib1;
 *     if (!lib1.load("libraryName")) {
 *         std::cerr << lib1.getLastErrorMessage() << std::endl;
 *         // exit, retry or whatever
 *     }
 *     // At this point you can call the functions and access
 *     // the symbols, e.g.
 *     int i = lib1.exportedFunctionWithOneArg("hi");
 * </pre>
 *
 * The currently available macros are:
 *  - SimTK_PLUGIN_DEFINE_SYMBOL(type, name)
 *  - SimTK_PLUGIN_DEFINE_FUNCTION(returnType, name)
 *  - SimTK_PLUGIN_DEFINE_FUNCTION1(returnType, name, typeOfArg)
 *  - SimTK_PLUGIN_DEFINE_FUNCTION2(returnType, name, typeOfArg1, typeOfArg2)
 *
 * These define methods in the derived class which can obtain the symbol
 * address from the plugin library as needed. The methods will have the
 * same signature as the library's exported function. In the case of the
 * symbol, a no-argument method named the same as the symbol will be
 * created. For example,
 * <pre> SimTK_PLUGIN_DEFINE_SYMBOL(int, myCounter); </pre>
 * says the library contains an exported external symbol of type int
 * named "myCounter". If the Plugin object is "plugin" then you can
 * access this symbol (read only) as
 * <pre> const int& counter = plugin.myCounter(); </pre>
 * The macros also define another method of the same name as the symbol
 * or function, but prepended with "has_". This returns true if the 
 * named object is exported by the library, otherwise false. If you try
 * to access a method or symbol without checking first, an exception
 * will be thrown if the library doesn't export the symbol.
