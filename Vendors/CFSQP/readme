CFSQP is a C implementation of the FSQP optimization algorithm 
developed by E.R. Panier, A.L. Tits, J.L. Zhou, and C.T. Lawrence.
The C implementation was coded by C.T. Lawrence. A C version of the QLD 
quadratic programming solver (due to MJD Powell and K Schittkowski) 
was automatically produced using AT&T's f2c software (with minor 
subsequent modifications to achieve ANSI compliance).
Information on CFSQP can be found in the FSQP home page at
     http://www.isr.umd.edu/Labs/CACSE/FSQP/fsqp.html

The CFSQP distribution consists of the following files:
  COPYRITE
  README (this file)
  Version*
  cfsqp.c
  cfsqpusr.h
  qld.c
  sampl1.c
  sampl2a.c
  sampl2b.c
  sampl3.c
  sampl4.c
  sampl5.c
  manual.ps
which, except for cfsqp.c, are available from the FSQP home page.
The source file cfsqp.c is available by e-mail.

We suggest that you keep all these files in a dedicated subdirectory.
File manual.ps is a postscript file, and should be printed for details
on the algorithm and use of CFSQP.

On a UNIX system, the command to compile cfsqp.c with, e.g., sampl1.c
would be

        cc sampl1.c cfsqp.c qld.c -lm

with cfsqpusr.h present in the same directory.
The results obtained should be compared with those given in the
User's Guide.

Finally, the file Versionx.x lists the enhancements in the
successive versions of CFSQP.
   
NOTE: The code is written so that if an ANSI compiler is being used,
this will be detected by the pre-compiler and ANSI compliant function 
definitions and declarations will automatically be used.

Please send us your comments.  Any feedback is highly appreciated.
