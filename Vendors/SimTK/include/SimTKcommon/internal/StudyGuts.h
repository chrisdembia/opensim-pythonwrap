 * This is the declaration for the Study::Guts class, the abstract object to
 * which a Study handle points. This is in a separate header file from Study
 * because only people who are extending the Study class to make their own
 * Studies need to be aware of the details. End users access only methods from
 * the Study class and classes derived from Study, never anything from
 * Study::Guts or its derived classes.
 *
 * Below is the physical layout of memory for a Study, and which
 * portions are allocated by the client program and which by the
 * binary library code. For binary compatiblity, only the side
 * which allocated a piece of memory can access it. Exception: both
 * the client and library side must agree on the virtual function
 * table (VFT) ordering of the client's virtual functions.
