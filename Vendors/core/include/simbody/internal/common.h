//       library (dllimport)
//   (3) we are building the simbody static library, or the client is
//       being compiled with the expectation of linking with the
//       simbody static library (nothing special needed)
// In the CMake script for building this library, we define one of the symbols
//     SimTK_SIMBODY_BUILDING_{SHARED|STATIC}_LIBRARY

// assume it wants to use the shared library. However, if the client defines
// the symbol SimTK_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES we'll suppress the dllimport so
// that the client code can be linked with static libraries. Note that
// the client symbol is not library dependent, while the library symbols
// affect only the simbody library, meaning that other libraries can
// be clients of this one. However, we are assuming all-static or all-shared.
