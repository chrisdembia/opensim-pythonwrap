 * MobilizedBody is an abstract base class handle, with concrete classes defined

/**
 * This is the base class for all MobilizedBody classes, just a handle for the underlying
 * hidden implementation. Each built-in MobilizedBody type is a local subclass within
 * MobilizedBody, so the built-ins have names like MobilizedBody::Pin. All concrete MobilizedBodies,
 * including the built-ins, are derived from MobilizedBody.
 *
 * There are three sets of methods used for obtaining MobilizedBody-specific data from the
 * containing System's State. These are:
 *    - State Access
 *    - Basic Operators
 *    - High Level Operators
 *
 * <em>State Access</em> methods simply extract already-calculated data from the State or State Cache, or
 * set State values. They involve no additional computation,
 * have names beginning with "get" and "set" and return references to the requested quantities rather than
 * calculated values. We divide these into routines which deal with bodies and routines which deal
 * with mobilizers and mobilities.
 *
 * <em>Basic Operators</em> use State Access methods to compute basic quantities which cannot be precomputed,
 * such as the velocity of an arbitrary point, using
 * an inline combination of basic floating point operations which can be reliably determined at
 * compile time. These have names beginning with "find" or a more specific verb, as a reminder
 * that they do not require a great deal of computation. 
 *
 * <em>High Level Operators</em> combine responses and basic operators with run-time tests
 * to calculate more complex quantities, with more complicated implementations that can exploit
 * special cases at run time. These begin with "calc" (calculate) as a reminder that they may
 * involve substantial run time computation.
 *
 * There is also a set of methods used for construction, and miscellaneous utilities. These
 * methods are primarly intended for use by concrete MobilizedBody classes and are not generally
 * used by end users.
 *
 * In the API below, we'll refer to the current ("this") MobilizedBody as "body B". It
 * is the "object" or "main" body with which we are concerned. Often there will be
 * another body mentioned in the argument list as a target for some conversion.
 * That "another" body will be called "body A". The Ground body is abbreviated "G".
 *
 * We use OF to mean "the origin of frame F", CB is "the mass center of body B".
 * R_AF is the rotation matrix giving frame F's orientation in frame A, such that
 * a vector v expressed in F is reexpressed in A by v_A = R_AF * v_F. X_AF is the
 * spatial transform giving frame F's origin location and orientation in frame A, such
 * that a point P whose location is measured from F's origin OF and expressed in F
 * by position vector p_FP (or more explicitly p_OF_P) is remeasured from frame A's
 * origin OA and reexpressed in A via p_AP = X_AF * p_FP, where p_AP==p_OA_P.

/**
 * The handle class MobilizedBody::Custom (dataless) and its companion class MobilizedBody::Custom::Implementation
 * can be used together to define new MobilizedBody types with arbitrary properties. To use it, create a class
 * that extends MobilizedBody::Custom::Implementation. You can then create an instance of it and pass it to the
 * MobilizedBody::Custom constructor:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * MobilizedBody::Custom myMobilizedBody(new MyMobilizedBodyImplementation(args));
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Alternatively, you can also create a new Handle class which is a subclass of MobilizedBody::Custom
 * and which creates the Implementation itself in its constructors.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * class MyMobilizedBody : public MobilizedBody::Custom {
 * public:
 *   MyMobilizedBody(args) : MobilizedBody::Custom(new MyForceImplementation(args)) {
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * This allows an end user to simply write
 * 
 * <pre>
 * MyMobilizedBody(args);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * and not worry about implementation classes or creating objects on the heap.  If you do this, your MobilizedBody::Custom
 * subclass must not have any data members or virtual methods.  If it does, it will not work correctly.  Instead,

/**
 * This is a subclass of MobilizedBody::Custom which uses a set of Function objects to define the behavior of the
 * MobilizedBody.  When you create it, you specify the number of generalized coordinates, and six Functions which
 * calculate the spatial rotations and translations based on those coordinates.  It assumes there is a one to one
 * correspondence between generalized coordinates and generalized speeds, so qdot == u.
 * 
 * Each of the Function objects must take some subset of the generalized coordinates as inputs, and produce a single
 * number as its output.  It also must support derivatives up to second order.  Taken together, the six Functions
 * define a SpatialVec giving the body's mobilizer transform.
