/**
 *  Six constraint equations. This constraint enforces coincidence between
 *  a frame on one body and a frame on another body. This is a combination
 *  of a ConstantOrientation constraint and a Ball constraint. The first three
 *  equations correspond to the perpendicularity constraints associated with
 *  the orientation constraint, the last three equations are the 
 *  coincident point conditions.
 * 
 *  The constraint is enforced by an internal (non-working) force applied at the
 *  spatial location of the frame origin on body 2, on material points of each body that
 *  are coincident with that spatial location. Note that this is somewhat asymmetric
 *  when the Weld is not properly assembled -- it acts as though the contact occurs
 *  at the origin of the frame on body 2, *not* at the origin of the frame on body 1.
 *  The orientation constraints on the other hand are symmetric, they are three
 *  "constant angle" constraints enforcing perpendicularity between body2's
 *  x,y,z axes with body1's y,z,x axes respectively, via an internal (non-working)
 *  torque vector applied equal and opposite on each body.
 * 
 *  TODO: Although the frame origins can be brought together by the Ball constraint, the
 *  perpendicularity conditions can be satisfied with antiparallel axes in addition
 *  to the parallel ones we want. Therefore the assembly conditions must include
 *  additional (redundant) constraints requiring parallel axes.
