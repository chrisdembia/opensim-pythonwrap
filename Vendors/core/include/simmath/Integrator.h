/**
 * An Integrator is an object that can simulate the behavior of a System through
 * time.  This is an abstract class.  Subclasses implement a variety of different
 * integration methods, which vary in their speed, accuracy, stability, and various
 * other properties.
 * 
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 * 
 * An Integrator is most often used in combination with a TimeStepper.  The
 * TimeStepper automates much of the work of using an Integrator: invoking it repeatedly to
 * advance time, calling event handlers, reintializing the Integrator as necessary,
 * and so on.  A typical use of an Integrator generally resembles the following:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * // Instantiate an Integrator subclass which is appropriate for your problem.
 * VerletIntegrator integ(system);
 * // Set configuration options on the Integrator.
 * integ.setAccuracy(1e-3);
 * // Create a TimeStepper and use it to run the simulation.
 * TimeStepper stepper(system, integ);
 * stepper.initialize(initialState);
 * stepper.stepTo(finalTime);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h3>Mathematical Overview</h3>
 * 
 * Given a continuous system of differential equations for state variables y, and
 * optionally a manifold (set of algebraic equations) on which the solution must lie,
 * an Integrator object will advance that system through time. If the full system
 * is continuous, this is sufficient. However, most interesting systems consist
 * of both continuous and discrete equations, in
 * which case the overall time advancement is handled by a TimeStepper object which
 * will use an Integrator as an "inner loop" for advancing the system across 
 * continuous intervals between discrete updates. In that case, in addition to 
 * continuous state variables y there will be a set of discrete variables d which
 * are held constant during an integration interval.
 *
 * The continuous part of the system is an ODE-on-a-manifold
 * system suitable for solution via coordinate projection[1], structured like
 * this:
 *         (1)  y' = f[d](t,y)        differential equations
 *         (2)  0  = c[d](t,y)        algebraic equations (manifold is c=0)
 *         (3)  e  = e[d](t,y)        event triggers (watch for zero crossings)
 * with initial conditions t0,y0 such that c=0. The [d] is a reminder that
 * the overall system is dependent on discrete variables d as well as y, but
 * d cannot change during a continuous interval.
 * 
 * By "ODE on a manifold" we mean that the ODE (1) automatically satisfies
 * the condition that IF c==0, THEN c'=0, where
 *     c'=partial(c)/partial(t) + [partial(c)/partial(y)]*y'.
 * This is a less stringent condition than an ODE with "first integral" invariant,
 * in which c'=0 regardless of whether c=0.
 *
 * [1] Hairer, Lubich, Wanner, "Geometric Numerical Integration: Structure-Preserving
 * Algorithms for Ordinary Differential Equations", 2nd ed., section IV.4, pg 109ff,
 * Springer, 2006.
 *
 * The discrete variables d are updated by the time stepper upon occurence of specific
 * events, which terminate a continuous interval. The Integrator detects these
 * using a set of scalar-valued event trigger functions shown as equation (3) above. 
 * An event trigger function for a particular event must be designed so that it has a
 * zero crossing when the event occurs. The integrator can thus watch for sign changes
 * in event triggers and terminate the current step when a zero crossing occurs,
 * notifying the system and giving it a chance to handle the event; that is, 
 * update its state variables discontinuously.
 *
 * The zero crossings of continuous event trigger functions will
 * be isolated quickly; discontinuous ones have to be "binary chopped" which
 * is more expensive but they will still work.
 *
 * We are given a set of weights W for the y's, and a set of tolerances T
 * for the constraint errors. Given an accuracy specification (like 0.1%),
 * the integrators here are expected to solve for y(t) such that the
 * local error |W*y|_RMS <= accuracy, and |T*c(t,y)|_RMS <= accuracy at
 * all times.
 *
 * TODO: isolation tolerances for witnesses; dealing with simultaneity.
