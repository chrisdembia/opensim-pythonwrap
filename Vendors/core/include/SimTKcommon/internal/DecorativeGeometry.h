/** @file
 * This is the client-side interface to an implementation-independent
 * representation of "Decorations" suitable for visualization, annotation,
 * logging, or debugging but which cannot have any effect on the behavior of
 * a System or the evolution of a Study. 
 * DO NOT confuse this with AnalyticGeometry which can represent
 * physically meaningful objects that may interact and change the behavior
 * of a System. However, an AnalyticGeometry object is likely to generate a
 * corresponding Decoration for visualization.
 *
 * Why is there a DecorativeGeometry facility at the System level at all, so far away from
 * any application program? That's because for crude visualization and debugging
 * purposes, the Subsystems themselves are best able to produce some illustrative
 * geometry. Otherwise, you need a special purpose visualization tool which understands
 * what's going on inside each subsystem. If you don't mind taking what you get, just
 * ask each subsystem to generate what it thinks would be helpful visualization. To do
 * that, the subysystems need a way to talk about geometry without knowing anything
 * about how that geometry will eventually get onto someone's screen. And that's why
 * we're here!
 *
 * Each DecorativeGeometry object has its own local coordinate system
 * and is defined self-consistently
 * but independent of anything else. Clients can associate these with a reference
 * frame (e.g. a body), and place the local frame of the geometry objects on the 
 * reference frame, or at a fixed transform from the reference frame. That places
 * the DecorativeGeometry objects in a scene. We support both 3D objects
 * which are attached to actors in the scene, and 2D "screen"
 * objects like titles which are attached to the display rather than the actors.
 * The classes here deal only with the local-frame definitions of the geometric
 * objects, not their placement in the scene.
 */

/* TODO: NEW TEXT -- NOT IMPLEMENTED YET (just thinking out loud)
 *
 * Each kind of Decoration defines a parameterized object, whose appearance
 * is specified once its parameters are known. Parameters will be scalars,
 * points, direction vectors, and transforms. These involve dependencies on
 * a fixed set of reference frames: the ground body frame, the moving body frames,
 * and the screen or viewing frame. The body frames are defined by the System;
 * while the viewing frame is defined by whatever application is communicating
 * to a user. The World frame of the viewer and the Ground frame of the System
 * are the same. At run time a System can always report the configuration of its
 * moving bodies with respect to Ground, and hence these can be placed in the
 * scene with respect to the World frame. A text label, for example, could be tethered
 * to a point on a moving body while defined to remain parallel to the viewing plane.
 *
 * In addition to their geometric representations, Decorations defined here can 
 * state preferences, if any, for a variety of viewing options such as color,
 * drawing style, and transparency. If left unspecified, the viewer will have to
 * determine how to set these options; if specified the viewer may want to use
 * the specified options but can override them if it has good reason to do so.
 * Many different implementations of Decorations are possible. The generic 
 * implementation is defined below as an abstract class; each viewer will use
 * a particular implementation that defines a concrete implementation for each of the virtual
 * methods of the abstraction.
 *
 * There are two Stages associated with a Decoration. When is the Decoration
 * known to exist (including its parameterization), and when are values for its 
 * parameters calculatable. For example, a permanent body-fixed sphere is known
 * to exist a the Topological stage (i.e., as soon as the body exists). Its 
 * configuration in the World frame, however, cannot be computed until we
 * know the body's configuration, that is, Stage::Position.
