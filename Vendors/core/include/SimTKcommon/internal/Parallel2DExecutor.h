/**
 * This class is used for performing multithreaded computations over two dimensional ranges.  That is,
 * it performs some calculation once for each pair (i, j) where i and j vary over some range.  For
 * example, it is useful for calculating pairwise forces between a set of bodies.
 * 
 * To use it, define a subclass of Parallel2DExecutor::Task that performs a computation.  Then create a
 * Parallel2DExecutor object and ask it to execute the task:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Parallel2DExecutor executor(gridSize);
 * executor.execute(myTask, Parallel2DExecutor::FullMatrix);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The Task's execute() method will be called once with each pair (i, j) where i and j vary between 0 and
 * gridSize-1.  You also can restrict it to only pairs with i > j or i >= j.
 * 
 * The invocations are done in parallel on multiple threads, but they are divided up in a way that avoids
 * index conflicts between simultaneous calculations.  If the task is executed with indices (i1, j1)
 * on one thread, it is guaranteed that no other thread is simultaneously executing the task with
 * either the first or second index equal to either i1 or j1.  (More precisely, if either index of one
 * invocation is equal to either index of another invocation, the two invocations are guaranteed to be
 * separated by a happens-before edge.)  This allows the task to modify data that is indexed by i and j
 * without needing to worry about concurrent modifications.
 * 
 * The threads are created in the Parallel2DExecutor's constructor and remain active until it is deleted.
 * This means that creating a Parallel2DExecutor is a somewhat expensive operation, but it may then be
 * used repeatedly for executing various calculations.  By default, the number of threads is chosen
 * to be equal to the number of available processor cores.  You can optionally specify a different number
 * of threads to create.  For example, using more threads than processors can sometimes lead to better
 * processor utilitization.
