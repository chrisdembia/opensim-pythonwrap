# FILE: 23.sd
#
# This file contains the system description for the walking model.
# It is a 23 DOF model.  Note that the rotational degrees
# of freedom are given in Euler parameters and that sdst2ang() must
# be called to convert these parameters to the normal 123 body-fixed
# Euler angles.
#
# The values in this file came from four sources:
#	Scott Delps Dissertation (SIMM)-  Total segment lengths
# 	McConville et al. (1981)-  Mass, Center of Mass, Moment of Inertia
#       Whitsett (See Ziegler's Dissertation)- Center of Mass of thigth & shank 
#	Joint center experiments in our lab.
#
# Anthropometric and joint center data were taken for 5 subjects in the BEL 530
# biomechanics lab.  The anthropometric data was input into regression equations
# from McConville et al.  The joint center locations for the hip and back 
# joints came from kinematic measures peformed in the lab (See Anderson's
# dissertation for details).  Joint center information could have been used
# for the other joints, but this would have meant scaling all the muscle
# origin and insertion data from Delp.  So, the total lengths of the segments
# of the lower extremity were taken straight from Delp.
#
# The posibility to prescribe each joint has been added.
