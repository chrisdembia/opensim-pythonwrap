/*******************************************************************************
The REA algorithm computes initial pelvis and back states that minimize
   		J = Wb*BackErr + Wp*PelvisErr + Wbsym*BackSymErr + Wpsym*PelvisSymErr
   where
   		BackErr - is the mean squared difference from experimental back angles (in deg^2)
   		PelvisErr - is the mean squared difference from experimental pelvis trajectories (in mm^2) 
   		BackSymErr - is the mean squared difference from a symmetrically repeating (or asymmetrically for lat bending, rotation) back angle trajectory every half gait cycle
   		PelvisSymErr - is the mean squared difference from a symmetrically repeating (or asymmetrically for lat bending, rotation) pelvis translational trajectory every half gait cycle 
   
   		Wb, Wbsym are the corresponding weight parameters for the 3-1-2 back rotation angles:  3(flex/ext), 1(abd/add), 2(int/ext rot)
   		Wp, Wpsym are the corresponding weight parameters for the x, y, z pelvis translations
   		
   		detrendPelvisError - option to zero order detrend the pelvis kinematics (x,y,z) prior to computing the pelvis error (allows for constant offset in exp data)
   		detrendBackError - option to zero order detrend the back kinematics (r3,r1,r2) prior to computing the back error (allows for constant offset in exp data)
