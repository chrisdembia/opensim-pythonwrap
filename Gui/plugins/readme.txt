How to use plugins in OpenSim
=========================

This directory contains user plugins (packaged as dynamic libraries .dll on windows) used to extend the functionality of OpenSim. 

Please make sure this directory is in your PATH before trying to load your plugin into the OpenSim application.
Also make sure the library is built using code base and compiler that are compatible with the OpenSim distribution.
To find out what compiler was used to build the OpenSim application, use the menu item (Help->About->Details:Build Info).
