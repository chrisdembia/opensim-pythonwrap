 * TreeTableModel is the model used by a JTreeTable. It extends TreeModel
 * to add methods for getting inforamtion about the set of columns each
 * node in the TreeTableModel may have. Each column, like a column in
 * a TableModel, has a name and a type associated with it. Each node in
 * the TreeTableModel can return a value for each of the columns and
 * set that value if isCellEditable() returns true.
