# This example script shows how to create and display a plot window. The script loads the 
# BothLegs OpenSim model adds curves of fiber length for the model. Then, it loads and plots 
# data from a storage file, which contains fiber lengths for the model Subject01_simbody
# that is included with the OpenSim distribution

# Load the model BothLegs.osim
filepath = getInstallDir() + "/Models/BothLegs/BothLegs.osim";

# Create a plotter panel and set the title

# Add curves showing rectus femoris and vasti fiber lengths vs. right knee angle and set the legend
