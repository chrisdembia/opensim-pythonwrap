
Introduction
------------

This first tutorial will introduce you to OpenSim, the Open Simulation Platform for NeuoMusculoskeletal modeling. This release of OpenSim targets building and analyzing subject specific gait simulations. The application is made up of a set of executables that follow a pipeline for generating and analyzing subject specfifc models given a nominal model, and a set of experimental data. OpenSim is developed by the support of ....


Prerequisites:
--------------
The user is assumed to have the following:
	- Good working knowledge of SIMM (from Musculographics) which is used for visualization purposes.
	- Access to a text-editor to edit the xml files used as input to the application.
	- An installation of OpenSim (either in binary format, or built by the user).
