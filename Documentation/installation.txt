Installation Instructions:
==========================

There are potentially mutliple user groups for OpenSim, based on different needs. One group does not have to develp code based on the OpenSim frameowrk and these users are referred to the "user installation" section of this document. Another user group is composed of users who are more programming oriented and as such will mostly build the code into libraries/executables and add their own classes, methods and or models. For this group we recommend proceeding with the developer installation that contains instructions on how to check out the source code (OpenSim is an open source platform) and modify it to fit their needs. The third user-group is made of researchers somewhere in the spectrum between the first two in terms of their C++ programming skills, but still need to create their own models for different subjects to derive their research. The needs of this group is addressed under "toolkit-user installation" section.

1. user installation
====================
1. Expand the zip file you downloaded into a directory of your choice. Recommended directory (under windows) is C:/Program Files/SimTK/OpenSim. We'll call that directory OpenSim_InstallationDir.
2. Add OpenSim_InstallationDir/bin and OpenSim_InstallationDir/lib to your "PATH" environment variable (make sure you don't have earlier installation libraries/executables appear on your path before OpenSim_InstallationDir/bin & OpenSim_InstallationDir/lib).
3. To run cmcgait and rra executables you need to 
	- Have a license file from RealisticDynamics Inc.
	- Set Environment variable RDI_INSTALL point to the directory containing the license file.

2. developer installation
=========================
Pre-requisites: 

OpenSim 0.5 runs only on Windows platform. Support for other platforms will be made available soon. It is also assumed that you have the following set of software tools installed on your machine already:
1. Microsoft's Developer Studio (Version 7.1 or later)
2. Subversion client (e.g. http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/).
3. Cygwin (perl module)
4. SIMM for visulaization (version 4.0 or later).
5. CMake (from www.cmake.org) version 2.2 or later.
6. SDFast (from Parametric Technology Inc.)

The following steps should allow you to build the executables that are part of the OpenSim 0.5 release.

1. Check out the source code from https://simtk.org/svn/nmbltk/Tags/Release_05_00 into a new blank directory (we'll call it here OpenSimTopDir).
2. Invoke CMake and browse for the source, and
	- browse for OpenSimTopDir and use it to fill in the top pick.
	- specify a directory for CMake to place object files (this directory doesn't have to pre-exist), call this OpenSimLibDir. 
2. Set the following environment variables:
   - If your version of DevStudio is different from .NET 2003 then you need to set the environment variable RDI_ARCH to indicate it (for example VC60 for version 6.0) otherwise go to the next task.
   - When you build with CMake you'll need to specify a location for the binaries and/or libraries. 
   - To build cmcgait and rra you'll need to check out the repository for the corresponding project.

3. toolkit-user installation
=========================
Pre-requisites: 

OpenSim 0.5 runs only on Windows platform. Support for other platforms will be made available soon. It is also assumed that you have the following set of software tools installed on your machine already:
1. Microsoft's Developer Studio (Version 7.1 or later)
2. Subversion client (e.g. http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/).
3. Cygwin (perl module)
4. SIMM for visulaization (version 4.0 or later).
5. CMake (from www.cmake.org) version 2.2 or later.
6. SDFast (from Parametric Technology Inc.)

For toolkit users, the use case is to download the libraries and headers and then try to generate and anayze subject specific simulations. The user needs to:
	- Download and install OpenSim0.5 from the simtk.org/project OpenSim/Downloads/OpenSim0501 as in user installation section.
	- Set env variables OPENSIM_INCLUDE_PATH to point to the include directory under OpenSim installation.
	- set env variable OPENSIM_LIB_PATH to point to the lib directory under OpenSim installation.
