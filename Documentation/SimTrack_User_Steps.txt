STEPS FOR SIMULATING DELAWARE SUBJECT 2 SELF-SELECTED WALKING TRIAL

1. From EVaRT, we have these files:
   - SS_walking1.anc (from EVaRT)
   - SS_walking1_smoothed.trc (post-processed correctly from EVaRT)
   - Static1.anc (from EVaRT)
   - Static1_smoothed.trc (post-processed correctly from EVaRT)
   Correct post-processing includes running Join Cubic on all
   trajectories, making sure all trajectories have no missing data
   at the ends of the time interval, smoothing all trajectories as
   appropriate, and making sure all unnamed markers are deleted.
   
   Copy these files to the directory containing Eran's scripts for
   preprocessing data for SimTrack.  On my computer, that directory
   is d:\programfiles\erang\matlab.

2. In MATLAB, go to the directory containing Eran's scripts.

3. Create new SS walking trc file with correct coordinate system.

   Run this MATLAB command:
   transform_trcFile('SS_walking1_smoothed.trc','delaware2_ss_walking1.trc',
                     delaware_lcs);

4. Create new static trc file with correct coordinate system.

   Run this MATLAB command:
   transform_trcFile('Static1_smoothed.trc','delaware2_static1.trc',
                     delaware_lcs);

5. Download unix2dos from http://www.esmerel.com/ewan/tools.html
   if you don't have it already, and make sure it's in your Path
   environment variable.  Try running it in DOS on a test file and
   make sure it doesn't complain saying "No such file or directory"
   on a file that does exist.  If it does complain, download the program
   from the web site above, since it's designed specifically for DOS.
   Some versions of unix2dos will work only in Cygwin or UNIX
   environments and not in DOS, and won't work properly when MATLAB
   calls them in Windows.

6. Preprocess the force plate data and create a .mot file containing
   the relevant data.

   Run this MATLAB command:
   process_grf('SS_walking1.anc',
               'delaware2_ss_walking1_newgrfprocessing.mot',
               'delaware2_ss_walking1.trc');

7. Create a "delaware2" directory to store all setup and data files for
   Delaware Subject 2, if you haven't already created such a directory.

   In my case, this directory is
   "d:\programfiles\FCA\SU\Testing\delaware2".

8. Copy the following files to the Delaware Subject 2 setup directory:
   - SS_walking1.anc
   - delaware2_ss_walking1.trc
   - Static1.anc
   - delaware2_static1.trc

9. Run Eran's program for computing functional joint centers to generate
   the file "delaware2_scaleSet_fromFunctionalJointCenters.xml" in the
   Delaware Subject 2 setup directory.

10. In MATLAB, go to the directory containing miscellaneous scripts from
    Eran.  For me this is "d:\programfiles\erang\matlab\misc".

    Here I also had to copy "write_motionFile.m" from erang\matlab to
    erang\matlab\misc.  This needs to be fixed!

11. Run the script to create a .mot file with all zeros called
    "delaware2_zeros.mot".

    Run this MATLAB command:
    write_static_motion

    And then copy the created file, "delaware3_zeros.mot", to
    "d:\programfiles\FCA\SU\Testing\delaware2\delaware2_zeros.mot".

12. Make a copy of "delaware2_zeros.mot" in the erang/matlab
    directory called "delaware2_ss_walking1.mot".

    I had to copy "delaware2_ss_walking1_newgrfprocessing.mot",
    "delaware2_ss_walking1.mot", and "read_motionFile.m"
    to erang/matlab/misc.

13. Run the script to add the force plate data columns to the motion file.

    To do this, run this MATLAB command:
    put_forces_in_mot('delaware2_ss_walking1_newgrfprocessing.mot',
                      'delaware2_ss_walking1.mot');

    Copy delaware2_ss_walking1.mot and
    delaware2_ss_walking1_newgrfprocessing.mot
    to the Delaware Subject 2 setup directory,
    d:\programfiles\FCA\SU\Testing\delaware2.

14. Open a DOS window and cd to the directory containing the Delaware
    Subject 2 setup file for scaling.  In my case, I typed "D:" and then
    "cd \programfiles\FCA\SU\Testing\delaware2".  Make sure this
    directory has the files needed to do scaling, including:

    - delaware2_CoordinateSet_ForMarkerPlacement.xml
    - delaware2_scaleSet_fromFunctionalJointCenters.xml
    - delaware2_setup_scale.xml
    - delaware2_zeros.mot
    - delaware2_static1.trc
    - delaware_measurement_set.xml

    Also, in the parent directory, you need the file
    "delaware_marker_set.xml".

15. Run scaling on Delaware Subject 2.

    Type this command in the DOS window and press Enter:
    scale -Setup delaware2_setup_scale.xml

    Be sure the current/working directory is:
    d:\programfiles\FCA\SU\Testing\delaware2.

    This generates several files, including:
    - delaware2_scaledOnly.jnt (before markers are moved)
    - delaware2_scaledOnly.msl
    - delaware2.jnt (after markers are moved)
    - delaware2.msl
    - delaware2.osim
    - delaware2_scaleSet_applied.xml
    - delaware2_static_trial.mot

16. View the results of scaling in SIMM.

    In SIMM, open the following files simultaneously:
    - delaware2.jnt
    - delaware2.msl
    - delaware2_static_trial.mot

    Then open the Model Viewer and click "start>" and "solved_motion",
    which plays one frame of data in which the virtual and actual markers
    are aligned in the display window.

17. Make sure you have the files needed to run IK, including:

    - delaware2.osim
    - delaware2_MarkerSet_ForIK.xml
    - delaware2_CoordinateSet_ForIK.xml
    - delaware2_ss_walking1.trc
    - delaware2_ss_walking1.mot
      (This file should contain zeros for all kinematics and have columns
       containing all the ground reaction data, since this kinetic data
       will be put into the output file delaware2_setup_ik.xml which will
       later be input to RRA.)

18. Run IK on Delaware Subject 2.

    Type this command in the DOS window and press Enter:
    ik -Setup delaware2_setup_ik.xml

    Be sure the current/working directory is:
    d:\programfiles\FCA\SU\Testing\delaware2.

    This generates the file "delaware2_ss_walking1_ik.mot".
    It also generates a file called "ik_setup_check.xml".

19. View the results of IK in SIMM.

    In SIMM, open the following files simultaneously:
    - delaware2.jnt
    - delaware2.msl
    - delaware2_ss_walking1_ik.mot

    Then open the Model Viewer and click "start>" and "UNKNOWN",
    which plays one frame of data in which the virtual and actual markers
    are aligned in the display window.

20. Create an SD/FAST model of the subject.

    1. Load joint and muscle files in SIMM
    2. Save dynamics:
       - sdfor.c (pipeline code)
       - params.txt
       - model.sd
       (You can close SIMM now if you want.)
    3. The directory d:/programfiles/FCA/SU/Testing/delaware2 is the "root
       directory" where I keep this subject's files.  From its subdirectory
       dynsim/src, copy model.sd to <subject>.sd in the root directory.
       Also copy sdfor.c and model.h to the root directory.
       WARNING: <subject> must be a string starting with a letter of the alphabet;
       if it starts with a number, the Visual Studio code created later will
       confuse the C++ compiler!
    4. Copy (scp) <subject>.sd to hill.stanford.edu
    5. Run SD/FAST on hill.stanford.edu (type "sdfast" and enter <subject>.sd when
       queried for system description file, and hit enter when it prompts for the
       dynamics, information, and simplified analysis filenames) to generate:
       - <subject>_dyn.c
       - <subject>_sar.c
       - <subject>_info (text file with gencoords, genspeeds, ...)
    6. Copy (scp) these three files back to your PC from hill.stanford.edu, into
       the root directory containing your subject data (where your joint and
       muscle files usually are).
    7. Run makeModelProject script in command line (fill in the path of the
       makeModelProject.pl file as appropriate for your computer):
       "perl /cygdrive/d/programfiles/OpenSim/OpenSim/Bin/makeModelProject.pl"
       which generates:
       - sdufuncs_darryl.c
       - rdModels wrapper files: <subject>.cpp, <subject>.h
       - Visual Studio files: <subject>.vcproj, <subject>.sln
    8. Build subject model libraries: open subject project and build it

21. Fix whitespaces in header of delaware2_ss_walking1_newgrfprocessing.mot by
    running "unix2dos delaware2_ss_walking1_newgrfprocessing.mot" in a command
    prompt or Cygwin window while you are in the directory
    d:\programfiles\FCA\SU\Testing\delaware2.

22. Create XML files:

    - delaware2_ss_walking1_rra_control_constraints_pass1.xml,
    - delaware2_ss_walking1_rra_control_constraints_pass2.xml, and
    - delaware2_ss_walking1_cmc_control_constraints.xml

    based on setup files from another subject like delaware3, and put these
    XML files into the root directory of delaware2.

23. In params.txt in the subject's root directory, make the following changes.
    I made the following changes to my params.txt file; adapt these changes to
    your own params.txt file.

    I changed the five lines under "I/O Options" from:

    muscle_file D:\programfiles\FCA\SU\Testing\delaware2\delaware2.msl
    #bone_path path_to_bone_files
    output_motion_file results.mot
    #kinetics_file forces.ktx
    output_kinetics_file results.ktx

    to:

    muscle_file delaware2.msl
    #bone_path path_to_bone_files
    #output_motion_file results.mot
    kinetics_file delaware2_ss_walking1_ik.mot
    #output_kinetics_file results.ktx

24. Run "cmcgait -Setup delaware2_setup_rra_pass1.xml" in Visual Studio or in
    the command line.

    Be sure the current/working directory is:
    d:\programfiles\FCA\SU\Testing\delaware2.

    See my setup file, delaware2_setup_rra_pass1.xml, for reference on how to
    setup your own setup file.

25. Run "cmcgait -Setup delaware2_setup_rra_pass2.xml" in Visual Studio or in
    the command line.

    Be sure the current/working directory is:
    d:\programfiles\FCA\SU\Testing\delaware2.

    See my setup file, delaware2_setup_rra_pass2.xml, for reference on how to
    setup your own setup file.

26. Run "cmcgait -Setup delaware2_setup_cmcgait.xml" in Visual Studio or in
    the command line.

    Be sure the current/working directory is:
    d:\programfiles\FCA\SU\Testing\delaware2.

    See my setup file, delaware2_setup_cmcgait.xml, for reference on how to
    setup your own setup file.

27. To view the CMC simulation, in the ResultsCMC subdirectory of your subject's
    root directory, make a copy of the delaware2_Kinematics_q.sto file called
    delaware2_Kinematics_q.mot and then open it in SIMM along with delaware2.jnt
    and delaware2.msl.

28. Copy the Results and ResultsCMC directories from the subject's root
    directory to d:\programfiles\erang\matlab\misc.

    NOTE: Every time you re-run RRA or CMC, you must put the new Results and
    ResultsCMC directories (and ResultsForward if you have run that already)
    into the d:\programfiles\erang\matlab\misc directory.

29. To compare the kinematics of IK with the kinematics of CMC, modify
    the "prefix" and "prefix2" fields (which are the "trial" and "subject"
    fields respectively) and then comment out and uncomment just the 2 lines
    representing the two files you want to compare, and then run the "compare"
    script in MATLAB.

30. Run the MATLAB script "check_forces" in the directory
    d:\programfiles\erang\matlab\misc after changing check_forces.m to match
    the motion and muscle file names for your subject and trial and copying
    the file delaware2.msl from the subject's root directory into the
    directory d:\programfiles\erang\matlab\misc and copying read_mslFile.m
    and find_columns_by_label.m
    to d:\programfiles\erang\matlab\misc from its parent directory.

31. Run the MATLAB script "check_errors" in the directory
    d:\programfiles\erang\matlab\misc after changing check_errors.m to match
    the subject and trial names for your subject and trial.

32. Run "forward -Setup delaware2_setup_forward.xml" in Visual Studio or in
    the command line.

    Be sure the current/working directory is:
    d:\programfiles\FCA\SU\Testing\delaware2.

33. In d:\programfiles\FCA\SU\Testing\delaware2\ResultsForward, copy
    delaware2_Kinematics_q.sto to delaware2_Kinematics_q.mot.

34. Add the SIMM header to delaware2_Kinematics_q.mot.  This is a set of lines
    that looks like:

    # SIMM Motion File Header:
    name Coordinates
    datacolumns 34
    datarows 1490
    otherdata 1
    range 0.500000 1.988500

    I had to change the number of datacolumns and datarows to match the nRows
    and nColumns, and the range to match the first and last values in the time
    column.

    Insert these lines between the "nColumns=34" line and the line saying
    "Units are S.I. units (seconds, meters, Newtons, ...)".  I leave an empty
    row between the SIMM header and the lines between which it is inserted, but
    I'm not sure if this is necessary.

35. Open delaware2.jnt, delaware2.msl in SIMM.

36. Open ResultsForward\delaware2_Kinematics_q.mot in SIMM and view the
    motion.
