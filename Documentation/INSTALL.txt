Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to run OpenSim, you need to add the "bin" directory to your Path.u
Use the following procedure in Windows:

- Right Click on "My Computer" and select "Properties" ("My Computer" will
  either be on your desktop or in the Start menu)
- Click on the "Advanced" tab, and then on "Environment Variables"
- Under "System variables", locate and select the variable called "Path", and
  click "Edit"
- Add "<location where you unzipped OpenSim>\bin;" to the beginning of the
  variable value. e.g. "C:\Work\OpenSim-0.8\bin;"
- Press "OK", and "OK" again to leave the Environment Variables dialog.  One
  last "OK" exits the "System Properties" dialog.
