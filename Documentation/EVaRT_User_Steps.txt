STEPS
=====

Launch EVaRT
------------
1. Log in as Delp, with no password, on the computer nearest the door and printer in the Clark Center motion lab.
2. Open EVaRT 4.6.

Load the motion capture data to be processed
--------------------------------------------
3. File -> Load Project...
4. Select HOME_DIR\SIMTK2_Dynamic.prj and click Open.
5. File -> Load Tracks File...
6. Select HOME_DIR\groucho_walk1.trb and click Open.

Setup up data views
-------------------
7. Click on the top window, click the Data Views menu, and choose XYZ Graphs.
8. Click on the bottom window, click the Data Views menu, and choose 3-D Display.

Identify the markers in one frame
---------------------------------
9. Click the Identifying button in the top right region of EVaRT.
10. Be sure Post Process is selected in the toolbar at the top of EVaRT.
11. Use the ruler and arrows to scroll to a frame that has the right number of markers, and that has all markers appear to be in the right locations.  In my case, the right number of markers is 41.
12. Click Quick ID ...
13. Click on each marker in order, as its name comes up in the Identify Marker window.  If you make a mistake, simply scroll back to the marker(s) you messed up on and click on the correct marker when its name appears in the Identify Marker window.

Create linkages
---------------
14. Click Model Edit in the toolbar at the top of EVaRT.
15. Click Create Linkages under Select Mode: at the top right.
16. To create a linkage between two markers, click on one of the markers (doesn't matter which one) and drag your mouse toward the other marker, and then release the mouse button.
17. If you make a mistake and want to remove a linkage, click on TreeView, and under Links, click on the linkage you want to delete, and press the Delete key on your keyboard.  When you're done, click Markers and Create Linkages to continue adding linkages.

Rectify (This is the most time-consuming step: can take anywhere from a few seconds to several hours to finish this step)
-------
18. Click Post Process.
19. In the bottom right corner, make sure the <-|-> button is selected (Select Visible Frames).
20. Click Rectify.
21. File -> Save Tracks As...
22. Save as HOME_DIR\groucho_walk1_first_rectify.trb.
23. Click Marker ID ...
24. In the botton right corner, choose ->|<- (Select Current Frame).
25. In Frame 39, I noticed a marker assigned as R.Midfoot.Sup should actually be R.Toe.Med, so I selected R.Toe.Med in the marker list and clicked on the marker to correct the problem.
26. Scroll through the frames and do this kind of Marker ID frame by frame as needed.
27. Periodically save your work as HOME_DIR\groucho_walk1_rectified.trb.
28. To remove a particular marker's data point at one time or a time interval, select the frame or set of frames and the right marker, and click Edit Tools and Cut.  Then click Identifying and go back to correcting the rectification.

Remove gaps
-----------
29. Click <-|-> in the bottom right.
30. Click Edit Tools in the top right.
31. Click on each marker in the marker list and click Join Cubic.  To do this quickly, start with the first marker, and then press the D key to move to the next marker.  So you can quickly alternate click-D-click-D-click-D-click...
32. File -> Save Tracks As...
33. Save as HOME_DIR\groucho_walk1_joined.trb.

Smooth trajectories and removed unnamed markers
-----------------------------------------------
34. Go through each marker in the marker list, and for any marker whose XYZ graph shows a caret symbol (^), click Smooth.
35. Click Delete U_n to remove all unnamed markers.
36. File -> Save Tracks As...
37. Save as HOME_DIR\groucho_walk1_smoothed.trb.

Write ASCII .trc and .anc files
-------------------------------
38. File -> Export Tracks W/Options...
39. Click Export Tracked Ascii (.trc) ...
40. Save as HOME_DIR\groucho_walk1_smoothed.trc.
41. File -> Convert .anc File (creates HOME_DIR\groucho_walk1.anc).
42. Exit EVaRT now if you wish, and click Yes. Exit the program.
