#
# This file contains the system description for a walking model
# generated for the research directed by Clive Pai, Ph.D. at
# the Clinical Gait and Movement Analysis Laboratory at the
# University of Illinois, Chicago.
#
# The inertial coordinate system is located at the surface of
# the floor.  the Y-axis is directed upward, the X-axis
# forward, and the Z-axis laterally to the right.
# 
# The model consists of 7 segments articulated by 9 degrees of freedom.
# The model is confined to the sagittal plane. The base segment is
# the right foot.  Its position is specified by a 3 DOF planar
# joint.  The remaining segments branch in open chain from the
# right foot.  The right ankle, right knee, right hip, left hip,
# left knee, and left ankle are all modeled as 1 DOF revolute
# joints.  The rotation axes for all these joints are aligned
# with inertial Z-axis.  Note that for the right side
# of the body the joint axes are in the direction of
# the positive Z-axis (laterally to the right), but for the
# left side of the body the joint axes are in the direction
# of the negative Z-axis (laterally to the left).  These
# joint axis directions were chosen so that a positive
# change in joint angle produces the same anatomical
# movement for both the left and right sides of the body.
# 
# The generalized coordinates (q) are listed below.  The
# name of each generalized coordinate reflects the motion
# that occurs with a positive change in the generalized
# coordinate.

# 0  RFoot_X      |The planar joint is located at the most posterior
# 1  RFoot_Y      |part of the heel where the heel contacts the
# 2  RFoot_Angle  |ground.  Positive rotation tips the toe up.

# Anthropometry is based on data obtained from 5 subjects.  The centers
# of mass, masses, and moments of inertia were estimated from regression
# equation provided by McConville et al. (1980) (Anthropometric
# relationships of body and body segment moments of inertia, Technical
# report AFAMRL-TR-80-119, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio).  For details
# on the anthropometry consult Anderson and Pandy (1999) (A Dynamic
# Optimization Solution for Vertical Jumping in Three Dimensions,
# Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering, Vol. 2,
# 201-231).
