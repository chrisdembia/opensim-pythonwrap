 * 
 * This class encapsulates all the state of the application. The state is maintained as 
 * a list of generic objects that get serialized/deserialized.
 * An instance of this class is created when a session of OpenSim is closed and is saved
 * to disk using the serialization mechanism. 
 * To make sure we don't run into problems if new objects are added to/removed from the list. 
 * Objects are placed into a hashmap that gets serialized.
 *  If we use Externalizable instead of Serializable we'll have to convert objects to use JavaBeans convention
 * for setters/getters.
