*
* The NodeMoveTransferHandler extends the class "TransferHandler" and
* overrides the method "createTransferable"
* where we state what happens at the beginning of the drag operation.
* There we simply test if the component is a tree
* and all selected tree paths are passed in an array to the "GenericTransferable".
* Additionally we call the methode "createDragImage"
* in order to create a semi transparent image of the nodes being moved.
*
* As soon as the user releases the mouse key, Swing automatically calls the method "exportDone".
* There we test if a node is selected, and this one serves as target node.
* Then we get all tree paths from the Transferable and each is moved to the new
* parent node (addNodes), respectively inserted between two nodes (insertNodes).
*
* The method "createDragImage" uses the cell renderer of the tree to get the components
* by which the nodes being moved are represented (usually JLabels).
* It then creates a semi transparent BufferedImage and draws the Components (JLabels) on them.
* The image created is returned using the method "getDragImage".
* ("getDragImage" is called by "paintImage" in "TreeDropTarget".)
