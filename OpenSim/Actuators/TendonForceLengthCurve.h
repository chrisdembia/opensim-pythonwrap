//                       TENDON FORCE LENGTH CURVE
//==============================================================================

/**
 This class serves as a serializable TendonForceLengthCurve, for use in 
 muscle models. The user has control over the strain the tendon undergoes at 
 1 unit load (e0), its stiffness at a strain of e0, and the shape of the tendon 
 curve (its `curviness') using the following parameters: 
 
  <B>Manditory Properties</B>
 \li strainAtOneNormForce

 <B>Optional Properties</B>
 \li stiffnessAtOneNormForce
 \li curviness

  All parameters but the strain of the tendon at 1 unit load (e0) are optional. 
 Note that both optional parameters must either be left blank, or filled in. 
 Filling in one optional parameter but not the other will throw an exception
 when the curve is built.

  The shape of the curve can be varied from a close approximation of a line to a
  sharply bent curve using the optional parameters. 

 \image html fig_TendonForceLengthCurve.png
 
    If the optional parameters are not provided, the tendon force length curve is
    fitted to match the average dimensionless in-vivo tendon curve 
    reported by Maganarius et al and Magnusson et al. In addition,
    the curve produced will have a characteristic toe region that appears
    in the in-vitro tendon testing literature (for example see Lewis et al, 
    figure 4), though does not show up strongly in the in-vivo literature. The
    curve is fitted using only the strainAtOneNormForce and this hueristic
    algorithm:
          
     \li stiffnessAtOneNormForce = 1.375/strainAtOneNormForce
     \li normForceAtToeEnd = 1.0/3.0  (see Proske et al).
     \li curviness = 0.5
     
     For strains less than 0, or greater than strainAtOneNormForce the C2 curve
     is linearly extrapolated.

     Note that this curve is not being fitted to the commonly used linearly
     extrapolated exponential curve documented by Thelen, as it makes the 
     toe region about half as stiff as both the in-vitro and in-vivo data
     indicate is reasonable, and additionally, makes the linear section of
     the curve nearly twice as stiff than the data indicates is reasonable.

 For more details on the fitting process see functions:

 \li TendonForceLengthCurve(double strainAtOneNormForce,
                            const std::string& muscleName)
 \li getStiffnessAtOneNormForceInUse()

 <B>Computational Cost Details</B>
    All computational costs assume the following operation costs:

    \verbatim
    Operation Type     : #flops
    *,+,-,=,Boolean Op : 1 
                     / : 10
                   sqrt: 20
                   trig: 40
    \endverbatim

    These relative weightings will vary processor to processor, and so any of 
    the quoted computational costs are approximate.

     Constructs a C2 continuous tendon force length curve. 
     
    
        @param strainAtOneNormForce
                    The tendon strain at which the tendon develops 1 unit of 
                    normalized force. The definition of strain used for this 
                    quantity is consistent with the Cauchy or engineering 
                    definition of strain: strain = (l-l0)/l0, where l is length,
                    and l0 is resting length. In this context 
                    strainAtOneNormForce = 0.04 means that 
                    the tendon will develop a tension of 1 normalized force when 
                    it is strained by 4% of its resting length, or 
                    equivalently is stretched to 1.04 times its resting length.

        @param stiffnessAtOneNormForce     
                        The normalized stiffness (or slope) of the tendon curve 
                        when the tendon is strained by strainAtOneNormForce
                        under a load of 1 normalized unit of force.

        @param normForceAtToeEnd
                        The normalized force developed at the end of the `toe'
                        region. The toe region lies between 0 strain and 
                        some intermediate strain less than the strain required
                        to develop 1 norm force. The toe region is characterized
                        by being both non-linear and more compliant than the
                        rest of the tendon.

        @param curviness    
                A dimensionless parameter between [0-1] that controls how 
                the curve is drawn: 0 will create a curve that is
                very close to a straight line segment while a value of 1 will 
                create a curve that smoothly fills the corner formed by the 
                linear extrapolation of 'stiffnessAtOneNormForce' and the
                x axis as shown in the figure.

        @param muscleName
                The name of the muscle this curve belongs to. This name is used
                to create the name of this curve, which is formed simply by 
                appending "_TendonForceLengthCurve" to the string in muscleName.
                This name is used for making intelligible error messages and 
                also for naming the XML version of this curve when it is 
                serialized.

         \image html fig_TendonForceLengthCurve.png

         This curve has the 
     advantage of being C2 continuous which results in faster simulations when
     compared to the popular method of using a linearly extrapolated 
     exponential curve to parameterize the tendon force length curve, which 
     is only C0 continuous. Details to appear in Millard et al 2013.
